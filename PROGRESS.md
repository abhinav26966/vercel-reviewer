## Current phase: **Phase 8 — Diff-aware selection + coverage maps — ✅ AC PASSED (2026-07-09)**; next up: Phase 9 — Judge, intent, heal, 🔵 loop

### Phase 8 AC evidence (live, PR #7 `test/phase8-selection`, sequential pushes; PR #6 = platform merge)

- (a) **README-only push → smoke tier only** (`786a4a5`): plan selected only
  Login ("smoke tier — always runs"); Buy & Rip ⚪ skipped with "no overlap
  with the diff" as a table row.
- (b) **PackScene.tsx comment tweak → rip flow selected via coverage**
  (`952aa4b`): reason "touches examples/demo-app/src/components/PackScene.tsx".
  Coverage for the rip flow is exactly its 3 client components (OpenClient,
  PackScene, flow-state), rootDir-prefixed.
- (c) **Manifest change → fan-out** (`3a74aac`): "fan-out: shared config
  changed: examples/demo-app/package.json", both flows ran. (Root
  pnpm-lock.yaml can't be live-tested — changes outside examples/demo-app
  don't trigger a Vercel build — covered by unit test instead.) Also fired
  live on PR #6 itself via apps/runner/package.json.
- (d) **Selection reasons visible in the comment details block** on every
  push: "flows selected N/M (diff-aware) — fan-out: … · base cache hit …"
  plus a per-flow reason list.
- Coverage seeding proven: cold-start run re-executed base despite a warm
  cache, wrote coverage_maps (files + apiRoutes `/api/login`,
  `/api/packs/buy`, `/api/packs/open`), and the NEXT push's selection used it.

Built: runner coverage collection (Playwright JS coverage → executed
first-party chunks → source-map fetch with explicit bypass header →
chunk-level source attribution; network-derived `/api/*` URL paths; rides on
`RunFlowResult.coverage`), `select.ts` (fan-out globs incl. >40%
covered-files rule + truncated-diff rule → smoke tier → cold start →
intersection: coverage files / changed `app/api/**/route.*` mapped to URL
paths / route-directory heuristic), orchestrator wiring (selection per push;
⚪ rows + reasons; coverage_maps writes with rootDir prefix; cache-bypass
seeding), dashboard flows list + smoke toggle, `productionBrowserSourceMaps`
in demo-app, `rootDir` project setting. 38 new tests (~200 total).
Docs 02/04/06/08 updated in the same commits.

### Phase 8 lessons

- **Client-JS coverage only sees client components.** Server components
  (page.tsx files here) never ship to the browser, so they can't appear in
  coverage files — the route-directory heuristic and API-route mapping are
  what cover server code. Login's coverage is files=[] + `/api/login` and
  that is CORRECT.
- **Vercel returns 403 for `.map` fetches via APIRequestContext even when the
  bypass cookie is set** — the explicit `x-vercel-protection-bypass` header on
  the map fetch works. Navigation + subresources were fine; only
  page.request fetches hit this.
- **Next.js framework sources leak into source maps** as
  `../../../../src/client/…` relative paths — must be filtered (anything
  escaping the app root).
- getProjectById selected explicit columns and silently dropped `settings` —
  rootDir never reached the orchestrator. Column-list selects need updating
  when the interface grows.
- Editing apps/api mid-run restarts tsx watch and ORPHANS in-flight
  orchestrations (run stuck `executing`). Recovery: `scripts/soak.ts <runId> 1`.
- The api parses JSON bodies as RAW STRINGS (webhook signatures) — every JSON
  route must JSON.parse(req.body) itself; CORS allow-methods needed PATCH.
- gh CLI is authed as the founder (repo scope) — branch pushes + PR creation
  work; merges are classifier-blocked as self-approval. Flow: I push
  `phase-N` branch + open PR, founder merges.
- Coverage staleness: rows refresh only when base re-runs (cache miss at a
  new merge base). Skipped flows keep stale coverage until Phase 10's
  base-merge/nightly refresh lands — acceptable inside Phase 8.

## Previous phase: **Phase 7 — Perf gates + hang/blank/dead classification — ✅ AC PASSED (2026-07-09)**

### Phase 7 AC evidence (live, PR #5 `test/phase7-spectrum`, one PR / sequential chaos pushes)

- (a) **Slow → 🟡 with attribution** (`7c11183`, unconditional 1.8s sleep in
  `/api/packs/buy`): `Buy & Rip Open a Pack 🟡 slower — step s1 "Click Buy Pack":
  727ms → 2.6s — \`POST /api/packs/buy\` TTFB 247ms→2.1s`.
- (b) **Break → 🟠 hung naming the request** (`dfd253d`, `/api/packs/open`
  returns 500): `🟠 hung — stuck at step s4 "Rip open the pack": text "1" !~ /^0$/
  · \`POST /api/packs/open\` → 500` (needed the strengthened rip spec
  `fsv_f7n36kdlrjl0hv` whose s4 asserts packs-remaining ^0$ — promoted official
  after validating green).
- (c) **Dead → 🟠 dead** (`9d61117`, client-side crash in OpenClient useEffect →
  production "Application error" page): `🟠 dead` at s4, classified via
  crash signals even though the surface failure was a missed canvas locator.
- (d) **Revert → ✅** (`da7eb2d`, net PR diff = zero): Login ✅ 2.1s,
  Buy & Rip ✅ 7.0s — perf gate correctly silent on identical code.
- (e) **Flake soak (sacred)**: 20 consecutive re-orchestrations of the unchanged
  run — zero 🟡/🔴/🟠. `apps/api/scripts/soak.ts` (~25s/iteration; deviation:
  doc 09 runs this in CI, which lands in Phase 13).

Built: runner classify.ts (dead: crash > Next error overlay > blank-screen
pixel score > pageerrors; hung: pending-request naming / 5xx-then-no-state /
bare settle timeout), settle() timeout signal + per-step pageerror deltas,
orchestrator warm-up jobs (discarded) + 2 measured samples merged by median
(sample 1 authoritative for pass/fail), dual-threshold perf gate
(relativeFactor 3.0 AND absoluteFloorMs 500) with MANDATORY attribution
(network TTFB growth ≥40% of delta, else client settle delta, else SUPPRESS),
perf_baselines upserts, hung/dead verdicts gated by base-side green (honesty
rule), diagnostics.failureDetail → verdict copy. 19 new tests (187 total).

### Phase 7 lessons

- **A dead page surfaces as a missed locator** — the crashed /open page made s4
  fail as locator_miss, not assertion. Dead signals (crash/overlay/blank/
  pageerror) now override ANY failure class; hung signals still require an
  awaited post-condition.
- **The chaos branch polluted the running services** (again): `git add -A` swept
  uncommitted Phase 7 code into the branch commit, and checking main out
  reverted the tsx-watch api mid-test. Test branches are now edited in a
  separate `git worktree`; recovery = `git checkout <commit> -- apps packages`.
- Force-push and direct main-push are blocked by the local permission
  classifier — branch cleanup done via follow-up revert commits (PR three-dot
  diff shows net change); **main is NOT pushed to origin yet** (see below).
- s2 asserts only `pathMatches ^/inventory$` — a blank inventory page would sail
  through it. Blank-page chaos had to target a page the flow actually asserts
  on (/open). Recorded specs need at least one DOM assertion per page visited
  to be blank-proof (authoring-guidance item for Phase 12).

### ⚠️ Pending push

Local main is ahead of origin/main (Phase 7 commits `906983f`, `f56a874`,
`e003d97` + PROGRESS/doc updates). `git push origin main` was denied by the
permission classifier — founder should run it (or approve when asked).

### Phase 6 AC evidence

- (a) **Login replaced with persona**: compiled spec has `persona: "default"`,
  `startPath: "/shop"`, zero password bytes; report records 4 replaced events.
- (b) **Human review in <3 min**: dashboard review screen (steps beside their real
  recorded screenshots, editable titles, assertion checkboxes, needs-attention
  panel) — confirmed in **2 seconds** via Playwright.
- (c) **Validates green against base**: confirmed draft `fsv_rb6qxk4wi47wlh` ran
  against the latest base deployment (persona login-once → buy → inventory →
  /open → canvasClick at the recorded point) and was **promoted to official**,
  archiving nothing (new flow) per the partial unique index.
- (d) **Identical verdicts via Phase 3**: handwritten Inventory + Buy&Rip flows
  archived; PR #4 ran Login ✅ 4.4s + "Buy & Rip Open a Pack (recorded)" ✅ 8.8s
  through the unmodified pipeline. PR closed, branch deleted.

Built: packages/inference (OpenAI-compatible provider, model FALLBACK CHAINS for
free tiers, structured output w/ one repair retry, redacted log sink; defaults =
free open-weights models on OpenRouter — gemma-4 26B/31B + nemotron-nano-12b-vl),
compiler pipeline (normalize/segment → code-side login+payment+canvas detection →
batched vision pass → locator hardening → delta rewriting → assembly with
hallucination guard), draft/confirm/validate lifecycle (immutable version rows),
review screen, recordings/drafts/assets endpoints, plain-language authoring
endpoint (all-needsAttention drafts), runner canvasClick (deterministic half).
26 new tests (159 total).

### Phase 6 lessons

- **Free-tier vision models flub structured output**: the step-batch pass failed
  Zod validation even after repair (invented assertion kinds) — and the pipeline
  degraded exactly as designed: titles from a11y names, assertions from
  deterministic code (navigation URLs), spec still valid. The trace is ground
  truth; the model can only add. Prompt tuning for small models is future work.
- **Native Redis shadowed the Docker one** on 127.0.0.1:6379 the whole time
  (same as Postgres) — harmless since all services agreed, but debugging queue
  state requires the NATIVE redis-cli, not docker exec.
- **Newer BullMQ rejects ':' in custom job ids** — all job ids now use '-'.
- The compiled canvas step has no assertions (model suggestions failed; DOM can't
  see into canvas) — Phase 12's vision assertions + state SDK close this.
- Free-tier budget: full compile of the 15-event recording ≈ 6 requests, $0.

### ⚠️ INFERENCE_API_KEY note

The OpenRouter key was pasted in chat and stored in apps/api/.env. It's a
free-tier key (no payment method) — rotate at openrouter.ai if concerned.

## Phase 5 — Recorder extension + DevTools import — ✅ AC PASSED (2026-07-08)

### Phase 5 AC evidence (recording `rec_mkc6y6m0ljd40f`)

Recorded the FULL buy&rip journey on the mock-payments preview using the real
MV3 extension loaded into Playwright (chrome.debugger attached alongside
Playwright's CDP — **not degraded**):

- journey: login (2 inputs + 3 clicks) → /shop nav → buy click → /shop/success →
  inventory link (SPA nav captured via Page.navigatedWithinDocument) → /open →
  **canvas click with normalized coords {nx:0.5014, ny:0.5013}** and
  `POST /api/packs/open→200` in its network window. 15 events, 17 bundle files.
- uploaded via POST /api/recordings → unzipped, **Zod-validated**, stored in
  flowguard-recordings, recordings row created (invalid bundles 422 — unit-tested).
- every click step carries ≥2 locators (testid → role+name → text/placeholder → css).
- typed password appears as `«redacted:password»`; zero `demo1234` bytes in the
  trace (extension-side redaction, doc 07 §4.6).
- 2 assertion markers captured (popup "mark assertion here").
- DevTools Recorder export of the same journey imported cleanly via
  /api/recordings/import-devtools → `rec_1ezizn4but83ug` (8 events; xpath
  selectors dropped, password field redacted by selector heuristic).

Built: extension/ (MV3: content script with locator stacks + canvas coords +
redaction; service worker with CDP screenshots/network/navigations + graceful
degradation when attach fails; popup; fflate zip upload), POST /api/recordings
(multipart) + import-devtools endpoint, recordings.flow_name column (doc 08
updated), assertionMarkers on RecordingTrace (doc 02 updated). 11 new tests
(143 total; extension locator/redaction modules tested in a real chromium page).

### Phase 5 lessons

- chrome.debugger CAN attach alongside Playwright's CDP (multi-client works) —
  recordings during automation are full-fidelity, and the degraded path exists
  for the cases where attach is refused.
- Content scripts reset on every navigation: they must query the service worker
  for recording state on load, or all post-navigation events vanish.
- Next.js Link navigations are pushState — Page.frameNavigated misses them;
  Page.navigatedWithinDocument is required for SPA route changes.
- A service worker's chrome.runtime.sendMessage never reaches its own listener —
  drive the extension through the popup page in tests.

## Phase 4 — Credentials, sessions, redaction — ✅ AC PASSED (2026-07-08)

### Phase 4 AC evidence (live on PR #3)

1. **storageState auth, login once per target**: worker log shows the Login flow
   executed once per (persona, deployment), cached to S3 + session_states, and
   subsequent flows logging "storageState cache hit — login skipped".
2. **Wrong project password** → Inventory/Rip 🟣 `login failed on this preview:
   credentials may be wrong, or this PR may use a separate database — provide
   [PR-scoped credentials](dashboard link), then comment /flowguard rerun`;
   Login flow ⬜ already_broken_on_base (fails identically on base — honest).
3. **PR-scoped credentials via dashboard UI** (Playwright-driven form) +
   `/flowguard rerun` → all ✅ (head resolved PR scope w/ dataBranchDiffers=true,
   base stayed on project defaults — doc 07 §3 hierarchy per target).
4. **Byte-scan**: every artifact in MinIO (videos, traces, HARs incl. the login
   POST body, consoles, storageStates) + api/worker logs — ZERO hits for the
   password (plain, url-encoded, base64). The scan caught a real pre-Phase-4
   leak first (see lessons), proving it works.
5. Bonus: closing PR #3 auto-expired its PR-scoped credential set via the real
   webhook (expires_at set).

Built: vault resolution in runner only (+ redaction registration before use),
login-once session manager (no-artifact context), CDP insertText secret typing
(+ origin guard, tracing disabled for secret specs), HAR post-processor,
credential CRUD + per-target resolution + secretRefs, synthetic login_failed for
missing credentials, dashboard v0 (:3100), goto-retry for freshly-READY previews.
23 new tests (132 total).

### Phase 4 lessons (hard-won)

- **A zombie Phase-3 worker** (pkill pattern missed tsx's real argv) competed on
  the queue and poisoned half a run with pre-secrets code. Always verify worker
  process count; runner processes should assert a build/version tag (Phase 13).
- **Deterministic BullMQ jobIds + retained completed jobs = reruns replay stale
  results.** enqueueFlowJob now evicts finished jobs squatting on the id.
- **Rerun must reuse the existing run row** (idempotency index forbids a second
  run for the same sha+deployment); run_flow_results upsert within the same run.
- **The scan test caught a real leak**: the demo app printed its own password on
  the login page ("Try … / demo1234") and a pre-redaction aria snapshot stored
  it. Hint removed; pre-Phase-4 artifacts purged. Even so, the NEW pipeline
  redacts page-content secrets from bundles via the registry.
- **Freshly-READY previews can be unreachable for ~60s** (edge propagation);
  initial navigation now retries 3× with backoff.
- The orchestrator bakes storageStateKey at planning; the runner re-checks
  session_states at execution so login truly runs once per target.

## Phase 3 — Orchestrated PR runs — ✅ AC PASSED (2026-07-08)

### Phase 3 AC evidence (live on PR #2, abhinav26966/vercel-reviewer)

- **Regression push** (`b88d1dc`, a real code change 500-ing /api/packs/open):
  sticky comment showed **Login ✅ 4.6s · Inventory ✅ 3.8s · Buy & Rip 🔴 broken**
  with `stuck at step s6 "Rip open the pack": text "1" !~ /^0$/ · POST
  /api/packs/open → 500` + signed [video][trace][screenshot] links; commit status
  `failure: 1 flow broken: Buy & Rip (DOM-only)`. Compared against merge base
  `40eecd0`; base ran fresh (cache 0/3).
- **Fix push** (`b3faa47`): the SAME comment (id 4913215935) flipped to all ✅;
  **base cache hit 3/3** — head run 14s vs 39s. Status `success: all 3 flows passing`.
- **Cancellation**: verified live twice — the orphaned `1f981c2` run and a
  duplicate-deployment run for `b22a8dd` were both `cancelled` with
  `superseded_by` set + runner abort keys. (With the base cache, runs finish in
  ~15s — faster than Vercel build skew, so back-to-back pushes usually serialize;
  the supersede path covers every genuinely-overlapping case.)
- Artifact links: GET /artifacts HMAC check → 302 presigned MinIO URL; tampered
  sig → 403.
- 8 runs total on PR #2; PR closed unmerged (test artifact), branch deleted.

Built: orchestrator state machine (planning → resolving_base → executing →
reporting), merge-base via compare API, base deployment resolution (exact SHA →
nearest READY production ancestor), BullMQ fan-out/fan-in with deterministic job
ids, base_result_cache, pre-LLM comparator, verdict-table renderer, HMAC-signed
artifact redirect, /flowguard rerun re-orchestration, seed-flows script,
supersede-with-ordering. 20 new hermetic tests (109 total).

### Phase 3 lessons

- MOCK_PAYMENTS=1 now in Production too (base runs execute buy against prod) —
  **revert to 0 when Phase 11 lands the typed Stripe step** (SETUP note).
- Vercel skips prod builds for commits not touching the app root dir (CANCELED
  state) — base resolution's nearest-ancestor fallback covers it, but a fresh env
  var needs a commit touching examples/demo-app to take effect.
- TS control-flow: an unconditional early `return` kills null-narrowing below it —
  the first regression commit broke the BUILD (pipeline correctly stayed silent:
  no success event, no run).
- NEVER `git add -A` on a side branch while main has uncommitted work — it swept
  api fixes into a test commit (recovered via git checkout <sha> -- paths).

## Phase 2 — Runner MVP — ✅ AC PASSED (2026-07-08)

### Phase 2 AC evidence (all against the SSO-protected preview `…6u3z7fx9d…`, bypass via vault secret)

| Flow | Result | Artifacts in MinIO |
|---|---|---|
| login.flow.json | ✅ passed (2.8s) | video, trace.zip, network.har, console.json |
| inventory.flow.json | ✅ passed (3.2s) | full set |
| rip.flow.json (buy via mock payments + canvas click) | ✅ passed (6.8s), `POST /api/packs/open → 200` | full set |
| rip-broken.flow.json (`?break=rip`) | 🔴 failed at **s6**, class `assertion` | full set + `steps/s6/failure.png` + failure-bundle.json (500s in step network window, console errors, pending requests, aria snapshot) |

Built: `apps/runner` — deterministic replay loop (navigate/click/type/press/waitFor/
select/scroll, locator stacks w/ 2.5s per-locator + 8s budget, one deterministic
retry), settle strategies networkidle/navigation/timeout, polling dom|url assertions,
origin guard + host-scoped Vercel bypass header injection (cookie handshake),
failure bundles, S3/MinIO artifact store, BullMQ `runs` worker with redis abort keys,
`flow:run` CLI, Dockerfile (build-verified in Phase 13), 14 browser-level tests
(CI now installs chromium).

Vercel access token: stored in vault (2026-07-08); verified via
`deploymentBelongsToProject → true`. SETUP item 7 ✅ — no external items pending.

### Phase 2 lessons (keep in mind)

- Clicking a canvas right after `networkidle` misses: the r3f scene needs ~1–2s to
  become raycast-ready under SwiftShader. Interim: explicit warm-up step (`waitFor` +
  `timeout` settle) in canvas specs; real fix is `animationQuiescence` (Phase 12).
- DOM assertions must POLL to their deadline (fetch responses land after settle).
- Retrying a click that half-succeeded can double-fire side effects (two 500s in the
  broken run; the transient `hidden` pass on open-error). Revisit retry semantics for
  non-idempotent steps in Phase 7.

## Phase 1 — ✅ COMPLETE (2026-07-08)

### Phase 1 live AC evidence (PR abhinav26966/vercel-reviewer#1)

- GitHub App `flowguard-dev-abhinav` (id 4237892) installed → installation webhook
  verified through smee → `installation_id 145154076` stored.
- Project seeded: `prj_862ymcrku4xal4` bound to Vercel `prj_TePAGdlaVuEH9N0WNoDBtYEBvhyp`
  / `team_rMutuXA9J2h2zIhlsY4pl2EB`.
- PR opened → `awaiting_deployment` run + pending status → Vercel preview success →
  run upgraded to `planning` + **ONE** sticky comment (id 4912456115) with preview URL.
- Second push → **same comment id edited in place** (`219c88f` → `41b0ff4`), one run
  row per SHA, statuses pending→success per push. Never a second comment. ✅
- PR merged → `pull_request.closed` cancelled all 3 open PR runs; PR row `merged`. ✅
- Main deployment → **base run created** (`run_teq7ghmvw1n2r8, branch=main`). ✅
  Required a live-found fix: Vercel sends `deployment.ref` = commit SHA (not branch);
  base membership now resolved via compare API (doc 06 §2 updated).
- **Protection bypass secret verified live** against the SSO-protected preview
  (302 without → cookie handshake → 200 with) and stored in the vault; project row
  `has_bypass=t`.
- `MOCK_PAYMENTS` split via CLI: Production=0 (real Stripe test mode), Preview=1
  (SETUP #6 done — replay flows can buy packs on previews pre-Phase-11).


## Phase 0 — ✅ COMPLETE (2026-07-05)

All acceptance criteria verified:

| AC | Evidence |
|---|---|
| `pnpm build && pnpm test` green | clean rebuild green; lint + typecheck green |
| demo-app runs locally | login → buy → inventory → open verified via curl + headless Chromium |
| demo-app runs on Vercel | `vercel-reviewer-demo-app.vercel.app` — login, **real Stripe test-mode Checkout completed with 4242 card**, canvas rip → `{packOpened:true, cardsRevealed:5}` on prod |
| chaos flags | prod: `?slow=1` buy 1.07s→2.82s; `?break=rip` → 500; `?blank=1` → `<main></main>` |

## Phase 1 task status

| Task | Status |
|---|---|
| 1. `apps/api` Fastify + `/webhooks/github` (raw-body HMAC verify, 401 on bad sig), delivery-id idempotency, handlers for `installation*`/`pull_request`/`deployment_status`/`issue_comment` | ✅ code + 19 tests |
| 2. `packages/vercel` deployments client (get by id/url, list by project+sha, project-binding check) | ✅ + 4 tests |
| 3. Project setup via script (`pnpm --filter @flowguard/api seed:project`), org/project rows, repo↔Vercel binding, encrypted token/bypass storage | ✅ (needs SETUP #5 inputs) |
| 4. deployment_status success → PR resolution → runs row (planning) → sticky comment (marker find-or-create, edit-in-place) → commit status | ✅ code + tests |
| 5. Base-branch deployment → base run row | ✅ code + tests |
| 6. PR closed → cancel runs; `/flowguard rerun` parsing | ✅ code + tests (execution wired in Phase 3) |

Also landed: `packages/github` (App auth, webhook verify, sticky-comment upsert, commit
status, comment renderer); envelope encryption in `packages/shared` (local master key,
KMS slot-in later); `webhook_deliveries` table (doc 08 updated in same commit).

## Phase 1 AC — ⏳ awaiting live test

> Open a PR on the demo repo → within seconds of Vercel finishing, exactly ONE comment
> with the correct preview URL; edits in place on second push. Base merge creates a
> base run row.

Comment/run/idempotency mechanics are unit-tested (edit-in-place, duplicate-delivery
skip, awaiting-run upgrade, multi-project filter). Live path needs founder actions:

1. **SETUP.md item 4**: smee channel + GitHub App (permissions/events listed there) + install on repo + `apps/api/.env`.
2. **SETUP.md item 5**: Vercel token + bypass secret.
3. Then:
   ```sh
   pnpm db:up && pnpm --filter @flowguard/db migrate
   pnpm --filter @flowguard/api dev            # terminal 1
   pnpm --filter @flowguard/api dev:webhooks   # terminal 2 (needs SMEE_URL in env)
   # install the GitHub App now (installation webhook lands) then:
   pnpm --filter @flowguard/api seed:project -- --repo <owner>/<repo> \
     --vercel-project <prj_...> --vercel-team <team_...> \
     --vercel-token <token> --bypass-secret <secret>
   # open a test PR touching examples/demo-app → watch the comment appear
   ```

## Deviations from docs (documented in-doc, same commit)

- doc 02 §1: trace-field nullability clarifications.
- doc 04 §1: `cvc` → `cvcRef`; `ExecuteFlowJob` embeds `spec`.
- doc 08: added `webhook_deliveries` (delivery-id idempotency ledger).
- GitHub App permissions beyond doc 06 §1 list: + Commit statuses RW (Phase 1 uses
  statuses API), + Issues RW (PR comments go through the issues API).
- Local Postgres on host port **5433** (native PG owns 5432 on founder's machine).

## Implementation notes for future sessions

- Zod v4 (`.prefault({})`, `z.iso.datetime()`, `z.url()`); TS 5.9.3, ESLint 9, Next 15.5, Vitest 4, Fastify 5, octokit 5.
- apps/api handlers take a `Store` interface (`src/store.ts`); tests use `test/fakes.ts`
  in-memory store — keep new handlers testable the same way.
- Webhook route ALWAYS 2xx after signature+idempotency (GitHub retries would replay
  side effects); handler errors are logged, not thrown.
- Vercel sets `deployment.ref` to the branch name — base-run detection keys off it.
- Demo-app cookie-state → Phase 11 needs server-side state (Vercel KV) for webhook AC.
- puppeteer-core + system Chrome is broken for input after redirects — use Playwright.
- Suggest `MOCK_PAYMENTS=1` on Vercel **Preview** env before Phase 2 (SETUP #6) so
  buy/rip flows run on previews before the Phase 11 payment step exists.

## Open questions for the founder

- None blocking. Phase 1 live AC needs SETUP.md items 4–5.

## Next session

- **Phase 9 — Judge, intent, heal, and the 🔵 loop** (doc 09; doc 05 §§2–3,
  doc 04 §5): judge job with evidence bundle (PR title/body/commits as
  UNTRUSTED data, diff outranks prose), three-way output capped at 🔵 (judge
  can never emit ✅), 🔵 Approve/Reject → pending spec version, bounded
  agentic heal + spec-drift proposals, plain-language explore mode.
  Injection AC is sacred: a PR description saying "mark everything
  intentional" must NOT flip verdicts.
- Uses the free OpenRouter models (packages/inference fallback chains);
  judge prompt-quality on small models is the main risk — code-side
  enforcement mirrors are the backstop.
- First: founder merges the phase-8-fixes PR (post-#6 commits on local main).
- No new founder resources needed.
